
These trial-by-trial ERPs were retrieved in order to probe into the interaction of Modality Switch and RT Group.
For this analysis, a novel method was tried in which a 'modality-switch weight' (MSW) was compared to a 
'corpus-switch weight' (CSW). The MSW was based on an alternative calculation of the modality switch that 
deviated from the established paradigm (Pecher et al., 2003). The CSW was the frequency of co-occurrence of the
property words in each context trial and target trial pair. This corpus frequency was based on the English 
translation of the original Dutch words of the experiment because the larger English corpus handled rare
co-occurrencies better (see R script for the calculation of both indices). 

Based on Louwerse and Connell (2011) and on the results of the current experiment, our hypothesis was that the 
MSW would better predict ERPs in the Slow group than in the Quick group, whereas the LSW would better predict 
ERPs in the Quick group than in the Slow group.

The results, however, didn't yield interpretable results. The overall switching effects did not increase over 
time, contradicting our data based on the standard paradigm of Pecher et al., and presenting little coherence
across time windows and electrode areas (cf. Plots folder, especially 'Plot follow-up interaction Switch-Group').
For this reason, and taking into account the novelty of this follow-up analysis, this analysis is not valid.
