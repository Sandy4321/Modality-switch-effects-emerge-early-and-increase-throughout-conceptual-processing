This large folder contains both the condition-averaged ERPs and the trial-by-trial ERPs. The former have the pre-processed ERPs in the 
'Analyses of ERPs averaged across trials' subfolder, while the latter have the pre-processed ERPs in the 'Trial-by-trial Export Files' 
subfolder. Besides those, the subfolders 'Raw Files' and 'History Files' define all of the original settings and analyses in Brain 
Vision Recorder and Brain Vision Analyzer.

KEY ON EEG MARKERS (three codes stamped at the onset of each trial in Brain Vision Recorder [Brain Products]).

The markers from each participant are available as .vmrk files in the 'Raw Files' folder. The first character is a capital 'S', not a number five.

Codes for items:
S1-108 = target trials
S109-216 = context trials

Target trials were coded in first because they are the most important. Yet, in the experiment, each context trial was presented before a target trial.


Key for Modality Switch conditions:

S217 = Condition TotalMatch, i.e., Visual-to-Visual
S218 = Condition EmbodiedMismatch, i.e., Haptic-to-Visual
S219 = Condition TotalMismatch, i.e., Auditory-to-Visual


Codes for conceptual modalities:

S221 = Auditory
S222 = Haptic
S223 = Visual

Trial order per participant, which was pseudo-randomized, was traced back from the 'Raw Files' (R script in 'Trial-by-trial Export Files') and appended to
the trial-by-trial EEG data set in the folder 'Trial-by-trial Export Files'.
